# hobby finder

This program will take as input your TikTok/Instagram data and match you to a personality group. The result is then mapped to a collection of hobbies to help you find the ones that fit you the most. 

Social media like TikTok and Instagram track your data so precisely that it is almost unthinkable. The thing is that they use it to make more and more money while trapping their users in an addictive loop. 

While it is difficult to stop them, we can try to educate people about it and help them find something more meaningful and more personal to do. Therefore, we use the data that these social media collect from the user and use it to help the user instead of profiting from him.


# The process

Instagram gives much more detailed informations about the data they collect than TikTok. This means it is easier to get valuable data out of instagram's data files than tiktok's. 

# Instagram

Instagram's algorithm creates a list of your interests and ad interests. This list can be directly accessed and makes it way easier to create a profile about the user. Moreover, we can track down the user's favorite accounts and get their bio directly from instagram. This allows the program to take all of this data and create a precise profile of the user.

# Tiktok

Tiktok only gives you what you already know. Your liked videos, your favorited videos, the people you follow, etc. This make it difficult to create an accurate profile of the individual. However, by using the hashtags on each video and creating a ponderation depending on if the video is in your liked our favorited or watched, we can guess some redundant fields of interest. This is a much longer process than Instagram's, but it allows the program to profit at least a bit from Tiktok's data
