# hobby finder

This program will take as input your TikTok data and match you to a personality group. The result is then mapped to a collection of hobbies to help you find the ones that fit you the most. 

Social media like TikTok and Instagram track your data so precisely that it is almost unthinkable. The thing is that they use it to make more and more money while trapping their users in an addictive loop. 

While it is difficult to stop them, we can try to educate people about it and help them find something more meaningful and more personal to do. Therefore, we use the data that these social media collect from the user and use it to help the user instead of profiting from him.
